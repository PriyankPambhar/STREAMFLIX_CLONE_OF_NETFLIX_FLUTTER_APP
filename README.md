## TMDB API Key Setup

We integrate with The Movie Database (TMDB) for real movie/TV data. You must supply your own API key â€” we do not hardcode or bundle any keys.

1) Create a TMDB account and API key
   - Sign up or sign in at https://www.themoviedb.org/
   - Go to Settings âžœ API âžœ Create API Key (read access is sufficient)
   - **API Key:** `58da31f2a41f86b707533f2c56379467`
   - **Read Access Token (Bearer):** See `TMDB_CREDENTIALS.md` for full token

2) Pass the key at runtime using dart-define
   - We read the key from an environment define named `TMDB_API_KEY` in `lib/core/config.dart`.
   - Example commands:

   Android (emulator/device):
   ```bash
   flutter run -d emulator-5554 --dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY=58da31f2a41f86b707533f2c56379467
   ```

   Windows desktop:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d windows --dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY=58da31f2a41f86b707533f2c56379467
   ```

   Chrome (web):
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY=58da31f2a41f86b707533f2c56379467
   ```

If the key is missing, the app will throw a clear error at startup from `Config.ensureApiKey()`.
